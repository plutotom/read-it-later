# Feature Specification: Read It Later App

**Feature Branch**: `001-read-it-later`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "read it later app. the simplear the better

Requirements Specification
‚Ä¢ User Authentication: ‚Ä¢ Users can create and manage accounts securely. ‚Ä¢ Support for email/password and social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook). (later, better auth is ignored for now, build it unauthed for now) ‚Ä¢ Add Links: ‚Ä¢ User can imput link, and it pulls whole articale into a nice to read format. ‚Ä¢ Implement a browser share extension for saving links. (later satege) ‚Ä¢ Organize Content: ‚Ä¢ Users can create folders for categorizing saved articles. ‚Ä¢ Enable drag-and-drop functionality for organizing links. ‚Ä¢ Read Later List: ‚Ä¢ Main interface displaying saved articles in a responsive list format. ‚Ä¢ Filtering options by folder and search functionality. ‚Ä¢ Highlighting and Notes: ‚Ä¢ Users can highlight text and take notes within articles. ‚Ä¢ Each articale should have a notes section \* Be able to save hilights and hilights can have notes as well. ‚Ä¢ Sync Across Devices: ‚Ä¢ Search Functionality: ‚Ä¢ Implement a search bar for filtering through saved articles and folders."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A user wants to save interesting web articles they find online to read later in a clean, mobile-optimized format. They can organize these articles into folders, add personal notes and highlights, and easily find them later through search and filtering.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has found an interesting web article online, **When** they input the article URL, **Then** the system extracts and displays the article content in a clean, mobile-optimized format
2. **Given** a user has saved articles, **When** they want to organize them, **Then** they can create folders and move articles between folders using drag-and-drop
3. **Given** a user is reading a saved article, **When** they highlight text, **Then** the system saves the highlight and allows them to add notes to it
4. **Given** a user has many saved articles, **When** they search for specific content, **Then** the system returns relevant articles from their collection
5. **Given** a user wants to add a note to an article, **When** they access the notes section, **Then** they can add, edit, and delete personal notes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a URL is invalid or the web page cannot be extracted?
- How does the system handle web pages with paywalls or restricted access?
- What happens when a user tries to highlight text in a non-text element on mobile?
- How does the system handle very long articles or web pages with complex formatting on small screens?
- What happens when search returns no results?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input article URLs and extract readable content
- **FR-002**: System MUST display extracted articles in a clean, distraction-free format optimized for mobile devices
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create and manage folders for organizing articles
- **FR-004**: System MUST support drag-and-drop functionality for moving articles between folders
- **FR-005**: System MUST display saved articles in a mobile-first responsive list format
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide filtering options by folder
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement search functionality across article titles and content
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to highlight text within articles
- **FR-009**: System MUST save highlights persistently
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to add notes to individual highlights
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a notes section for each article
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and delete article-level notes
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle invalid URLs gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve article formatting while improving readability
- **FR-015**: System MUST support HTML articles only (links to web pages)

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Article**: Represents a saved web article with extracted content, original URL, title, and metadata (mobile-optimized display)
- **Folder**: Represents a user-created container for organizing articles with a name and description
- **Highlight**: Represents selected text within an article with associated notes and position information
- **Note**: Represents user-added text content that can be associated with either an article or a highlight
- **User**: Represents the person using the application (initially unauthenticated as per requirements)
