# Feature Specification: Shadcn UI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-shadcn-ui-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "can you help me plan out how to add shadcn ui to my app? the whole thing!"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A developer wants to integrate Shadcn UI components into their existing Next.js application to improve the user interface with consistent, accessible, and modern design components.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has an existing Next.js application, **When** they install Shadcn UI, **Then** the system provides a complete setup with all necessary dependencies and configuration
2. **Given** a developer wants to use Shadcn UI components, **When** they import and use components, **Then** the components render correctly with proper styling and functionality
3. **Given** a developer needs to customize Shadcn UI components, **When** they modify component styles, **Then** the changes are applied consistently across the application
4. **Given** a developer wants to add new Shadcn UI components, **When** they use the CLI to add components, **Then** the components are properly installed and configured
5. **Given** a developer needs to maintain type safety, **When** they use Shadcn UI components, **Then** all components are fully typed with TypeScript

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Shadcn UI components conflict with existing CSS styles?
- How does the system handle component customization that breaks the design system?
- What happens when Shadcn UI dependencies conflict with existing project dependencies?
- How does the system handle TypeScript type conflicts between Shadcn UI and existing types?
- What happens when Shadcn UI components don't match the existing design requirements?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST install Shadcn UI with all required dependencies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge)
- **FR-002**: System MUST configure Tailwind CSS to work with Shadcn UI component styles
- **FR-003**: System MUST set up the components.json configuration file with proper paths and settings
- **FR-004**: System MUST install and configure the Shadcn UI CLI for component management
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a utility function (cn) for conditional class merging
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all Shadcn UI components are fully typed with TypeScript
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate Shadcn UI with existing Next.js app directory structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing T3 Stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Drizzle, tRPC, BetterAuth)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide examples of common Shadcn UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure proper CSS purging and optimization for production builds
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain existing ESLint and Prettier configuration compatibility
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear documentation for component usage and customization
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure all components are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines
- **FR-014**: System MUST support dark mode if configured in the application
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain existing build and deployment processes

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Component**: Represents a Shadcn UI component with its TypeScript types, styling, and configuration
- **Configuration**: Represents the components.json file that defines paths, aliases, and component settings
- **Utility**: Represents helper functions like cn() for class merging and component utilities
- **Theme**: Represents the design system configuration including colors, spacing, and typography
